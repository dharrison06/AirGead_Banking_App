# AirGead_Banking_App

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project had me designing a functional, simplistic banking app that printed a report of financial standing given various inputs.

# What did you do particularly well?
This banking app ended up working perfectly through the usage of several different functions and following industry standard best practices.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Improvements to the code could be to further simplify these functions for legibility reasons and cleaning up main.cpp

# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
After planning out this project with the pseudocode, the majority of this project proved to be rather easy with the exception of a few bugs and formatting errors. Patience, debugging, and the occasional search on StackOverflow helped a ton.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Developing OOP applications in C++ is a great skill to learn from this project and I have already put it into practice in some smaller projects that help with some of my hobbies or assignments in other courses.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The excessive comments are one of the major factors in making this project perfectly readable, I tend to be all over the place in my solutions, so having my own written explanations for why I added a line or two makes the code much more easily digestible.
